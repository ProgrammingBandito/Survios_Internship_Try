# Survios_Internship_Try
This game is a half-baked attempt at a racketball game. It was my first attempt at Unity and while I acknowledge that this is no excuse, the time spent was eaten by engineering study work.  

Controls:

-Spacebar = Quit Game

-Left-Click = Hit ball

Walking and Mouse Look are normal FPS controls i.e. WASD.
